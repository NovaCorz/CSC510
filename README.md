## 🏛️ Governance Model

Food Seer is maintained as an open-source project by its core development team.  
Project decisions — including new features, bug fixes, and roadmap updates — are made collaboratively through discussion and consensus among contributors.

While we do not currently have a formal governance structure, our guiding principles are:

- **Transparency:** All changes are proposed and reviewed publicly through GitHub pull requests.  
- **Collaboration:** Contributions are encouraged from all team members and external participants.  
- **Consensus-based Decision-Making:** Updates and feature changes are approved when all active contributors agree on the direction.  
- **Future Growth:** As the project expands and attracts more contributors, we plan to introduce a clearer governance model outlining maintainer roles, voting processes, and long-term project stewardship.

This approach ensures Food Seer remains both open and adaptable while maintaining high standards for code quality and collaboration.

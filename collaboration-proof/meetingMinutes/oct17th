We are having our second meeting today.
Members then presented their progress reports for what they have gotten done since our last meeting and what they still need to get done.
  Chase: Implemented food, order, and inventory classes. Still need to make more tests to increased coverage.
  Justin: Made the README and a lot of the other documents needed. Still needs to fix some of the GitHub badges.
  Mukul: Has basic frontend starter done. However, a lot more of work needs to be done as the backend was not finished yet.
  Andrew: Got the entire account creation/authentication system made. Needs to make more tests so that we can get more coverage.

We planned our next meeting for 24th. 
It seems like every member is pulling their weight and contributing to the project.

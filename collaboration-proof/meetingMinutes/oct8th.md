We met as soon as we received feedback for our poster.
We reviewed feedback received and made changes to our milestones.
We made the decision that we will try and add the AI chatbot into the first set of milestones.
We also split the group into the following sections:
  Chase: Backend implementation for the order, food, and inventory.
  Justin: Documentation, github badges, and code reviewer.
  Andrew: Backend implementation for user account creation/deletion/registration/authentication
  Mukul: Frontend design and implementation based off backend

The reason for this split is that we choose everyone strong point to be their main focus.
However, group members can work on any part of the project when they get finished with their part
We planned our next meeting for 17th of october to do a progress report

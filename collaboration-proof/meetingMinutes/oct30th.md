This is our 4th meeting.
Each member discussed what they worked on since last time and what they are currently working on
  Chase: Got a lot of test cases done increasing the test coverage to over 80 percent. Will work on adding more tests so that we can get over 100 unit tests running.
  Justin: Started working on the poster so that we can get it out to other groups ASAP. Fixed issue with code coverage badge.
  Andrew: Working on getting frontend tests done. Has completed the entire backend implementation of the AI chatbot.
  Mukul: Has got started on implementing the AI chatbot on the frontend. Still needs more time to get it fully implemented.

Everything seems like it will be done before the Nov 6th deadline.
The group will meet on the 5th to go over everything before the deadline

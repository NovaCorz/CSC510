## Coding Standards

To maintain code quality across the Food Seer project, please follow these coding standards for both backend (Java) and frontend (JavaScript/React) development:

### Backend (Java) Standards

- **Code Formatting**: We use **Google Java Format** for consistent code style. Format your code before submitting:
```bash
# Using Maven plugin
mvn com.coveo:fmt-maven-plugin:format

# Or download and use google-java-format JAR
java -jar google-java-format.jar --replace $(find . -name "*.java")
```

- **Linting**: We use **Checkstyle** to enforce Java coding conventions. Run Checkstyle locally and resolve any reported issues:
```bash
# Using Maven
mvn checkstyle:check

# View the report
open target/site/checkstyle.html
```

- **Static Analysis**: **SpotBugs** is used to identify potential bugs and code quality issues:
```bash
# Using Maven
mvn spotbugs:check

# Generate GUI report
mvn spotbugs:gui
```

- **Code Quality Standards**:
  - Follow Java naming conventions (camelCase for methods/variables, PascalCase for classes)
  - Maximum method complexity: 10 (cyclomatic complexity)
  - Maximum line length: 120 characters
  - All public methods must have Javadoc comments
  - Use meaningful variable and method names

### Frontend (JavaScript/React) Standards

- **Code Formatting**: We use **Prettier** for automatic formatting. Run Prettier before submitting your code:
```bash
# Format all files
npm run format

# Or run Prettier directly
npx prettier --write "src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx,json,css,md}"
```

- **Linting**: We use **ESLint** to enforce code quality and catch potential errors:
```bash
# Run ESLint
npm run lint

# Fix auto-fixable issues
npm run lint:fix
```

- **Type Checking** (if using TypeScript):
```bash
# Run type checking
npm run type-check
```

- **Code Quality Standards**:
  - Follow Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide
  - Use functional components with hooks (avoid class components)
  - Maximum function complexity: 10
  - Maximum line length: 100 characters
  - Prop validation required for all components (PropTypes or TypeScript)

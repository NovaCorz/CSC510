Our groups used a variety of ways to talk to each other during the course of Project 2.
Due to this, it was really hard to gather all of our conversations in one place. 
This was made even more difficult as we preferred to meet in person to get work done instead of messaging each other online.
This lead us to taking meeting minutes during all of the meeting we had. They can be found in the meetingMinutes folder.
When we texted, used discord, or other online channels, we have posted screenshots or the text in a .txt format in the folder called onlineCommunication.
